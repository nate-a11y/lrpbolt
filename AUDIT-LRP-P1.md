# LRP Portal Phase-1 Audit — 2025-10-03

## Summary
- Added unified time utility shim with dayjs UTC/tz patching and null-safe helpers.
- Introduced Firestore service core with error/retry utilities and tickets-focused fs shim.
- Updated Tickets grid to use new fs services, provide real Undo via captured snapshots, and launch scanner from FAB.
- Hardened TicketScanner to stop camera after reads and prevent duplicate scans while logging driver context.
- Installed TimeLogs façade delegating to legacy service for Phase-1 compatibility.
- Registered repo-doctor and ui-polish agents in `src/agents/agents.json`.

## TODO (Phase-2)
- Migrate legacy `timeLogs` implementations into the fs shim with retry-enabled writes.
- Add structured batch operations and pagination helpers across fs services.
- Harden service worker push handling once Phase-1 data flows stabilize.
