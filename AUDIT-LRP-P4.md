# LRP Platform Audit — Phase 4

## Summary
- Added `LrpDataGridPro` wrapper with persisted density/visibility, toolbar quick filter debounce (500 ms), export, and default overlays.
- Migrated Tickets, ClaimedRidesGrid, LiveRidesGrid, AdminTimeLog (Entries, WeeklySummary, ShootoutStats, ShootoutSummary), and RideQueueGrid to the shared wrapper.
- Applied null-safe getters across key columns (link, scan status, driver, duration) with "N/A" fallbacks and timezone-aware formatting.
- Ensured accessibility enhancements via ariaV7, focus outlines, and consistent toolbar controls.
- Updated theme DataGrid defaults to align with brand palette and added README guidance for the shared grid.

## Notes
- No required files were missing; all targeted components were updated.
