# LRP Driver Portal â€” Phase 8a Audit

## Summary
- Added global UX primitives (SnackbarProvider, ErrorBoundary, LiveRegion, LoadingButtonLite, SectionState) and supporting hooks/utilities (haptics, useDebouncedValue).
- Replaced legacy ToastProvider wiring with SnackbarProvider at the application root and broadcast aria-live updates.
- Updated the theme to enforce dark mode palette, focus-visible outlines, and reduced-motion preferences.
- Guarded analytics initialization against duplicate runs and refreshed agent guidance for UI polish rules.
