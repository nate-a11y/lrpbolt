## 🔶 Recommended Improvements

### Performance

1. **Reduce Console Logging** (151 console statements found)
   - Many are already behind `import.meta.env.DEV` guards ✅
   - Consider using a logger utility to strip all logs in production
   - Files with most console usage:
     - src/vendor/sheetjs/xlsx.mjs (vendor file, acceptable)
     - src/pwa/* (debug logging for PWA features)
     - src/utils/* (development helpers)

2. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Current warning limit: 2000KB (very generous)
   - **Recommendation**: Lower to 800KB and optimize large chunks
   - Run `npm run analyze` to visualize bundle
   - Consider lazy loading MUI components where possible

3. **Image Optimization**
   - ✅ Already converting to WebP format
   - Consider responsive images with `<picture>` element
   - Add width/height attributes to prevent CLS

### Accessibility

4. **Run Automated Audits**
   ```bash
   npm install -D @axe-core/cli
   npx axe-core http://localhost:4173
   ```

5. **Manual Testing Checklist**
   - [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Esc)
   - [ ] Test screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
   - [ ] Verify focus indicators on all interactive elements
   - [ ] Test form validation announcements
   - [ ] Verify modal focus trapping

### Best Practices

6. **HTTPS Only**
   - Ensure all external resources use HTTPS
   - ✅ Google Fonts already use HTTPS

7. **CSP (Content Security Policy)**
   - Consider adding CSP headers for enhanced security
   - Example:
     ```html
     <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;">
     ```

8. **Robots.txt**
   - Add robots.txt if you want to control search engine indexing
   - For private portal, consider:
     ```
     User-agent: *
     Disallow: /
     ```

## 📊 Expected Lighthouse Scores

With these improvements, you should achieve:

- **Performance**: 90-95+ (with bundle optimization)
- **Accessibility**: 95-100 (with manual testing)
- **Best Practices**: 95-100
- **SEO**: 100
- **PWA**: 100 (if service worker is properly configured)

## 🧪 How to Run Lighthouse

### Option 1: Chrome DevTools
1. Open site in Chrome
2. F12 → Lighthouse tab
3. Click "Analyze page load"

### Option 2: Lighthouse CI (when installed)
```bash
npm install -D @lhci/cli
npm run lh
```

### Option 3: Command Line
```bash
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4173 --view
```

## 🎯 Priority Actions

1. **High Priority**
   - Run full Lighthouse audit after building
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify all forms have proper labels

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Lower bundle size warning limit
   - Add CSP headers
   - Run automated accessibility tests

3. **Low Priority**
   - Add robots.txt if needed
   - Consider additional responsive images
   - Profile bundle with visualizer

## 📝 Notes

- Site already has excellent PWA foundations
- Firebase integration is well-optimized
- MUI components generally have good a11y built-in
- Lazy loading already implemented for route components
